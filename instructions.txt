Write a Django + VueJS application. 

Features to include:
# A super admin can create users of types client and service provider
# Service providers can post their services on the website
# Clients can see these posts made by all the service providers
# Clients can contact the service providers (add a `contact me` button on every post and an email should go to service providers. Use any of async libraries for this (example: celery, rq). You dont have to send real emails, use console backend to print the email bodies) 
# Service providers can see their own posts only
# User needs to login to do any actions on the website

Keep in mind:
- Backend should use django (version > 2.0) and django rest framework
- Make sure you follow PEP8 and ESLint to format your code.
# frontend should use VueJS along with basic HTML + CSS, we dont need fancy UI. Only the skeleton is fine.
# Brownie points if you write some unit tests and a happy Travis-CI.
- Create a github repo and 
# share this repo when you are done.

# # Which features of Django framework to include in your code:
# Write Class based views
# Write Viewset (DRF feature)
# User authentication
# Logging
# Serializers (DRF feature) 
# Use of filterset
# Also use VueJS features such as filters, directives etc.
